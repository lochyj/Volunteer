//TODO: probably remove refresh tokens as they arent really used...
// TODO: migrate away from usernames and towards uuids

// TODO: add requirements to the volunteer application
//TODO: add link to website on createEvent
//TODO: add error handling on client side

//TODO: the entire application is easily subject to html injection attacks, either fix this or highlight it in the report
